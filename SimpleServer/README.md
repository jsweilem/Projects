# README

This folder contains a simple HTTP client (Thor) which will hammer a remote HTTP server by making multiple requests. Also, this folder contains a simple HTTP server (Spidey), which can support directory listings, static files, and CGI scripts. 

Along with these main programs (spidey.c and thor.py), there are a multitude of other programs in src to assist these two with the client and server. There also are example files which the server can handle in the www folder.

The code is mostly commented explaining what each function/segment of a program does.
