The beta version of a start-up project that I’ve been working with has finally been released. STUDIA is meant to be an affordable and accessible alternative to using textbook problems to study. Every single problem is unique to us made by physics grad students at ND. For now we have decided to do a rushed and free beta release in light of COVID -19 to help students prepare for finals. Right now we only cover physics 1 topics but we are looking to expand to other science subjects in the future. Please share https://studia.app/ with any students you know taking a physics 1 course, even if you are not taking physics, take a moment to take a look and give feedback using the link in our homepage.

If you ACTUALLY want to visualize the algorithms we coded, go to the same site but check the preemptive splitting/merging box.
