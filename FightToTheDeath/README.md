Welcome to the Battle to the Death!

Originally, this program was meant to be one fighter attacking a random moving "computer" controlled fighter. This proved to be sort of boring so I made the boss user controlled!

Apart from the comments, there really is not too much to explain but I will give the brief summary so the code makes sense. Basically, there are two fighters, where one is on the attack qnd the other is "boss" that is trying to avoid the shots for as long as possible. The fighter uses the a and d keys to move with s to fire while player 2 uses the j and l keys to move(these movements are slightly more dramatic). When the boss is hit and loses lives, it get a slight speed boost to make it harder for the opponent to finish them off. Also, when a shot is fired, firing a subsequent shot overwrites the original shot, so it is not advised to rapid tap the shoot button since the shots will never make it far enough.  

Most of the rest of the game is self explanatory, but the code has comments as to how the actual game mechanics work. Please enjoy!
